This was an evolving lab from ICS-221, Web Services. 
It includes a React frontend in `/app` and an Express API in `/api`.
The `/doc` folder contains a documentation config that can spawn a generated documentation site.
Run the docker-compose file with `docker-compose up -v -d` to launch the MongoDB instance.

There is also a branch that uses GraphQL to wrap the Express API as a test.
